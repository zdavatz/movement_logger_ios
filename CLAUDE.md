# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

iOS port of `~/Documents/software/movement_logger_android` (Jetpack Compose + Kotlin), which is itself an Android port of the Movement Logger desktop app at `~/Documents/software/fp-sns-stbox1/Utilities/rust`. Talks to the PumpTsueri SensorTile.box over BLE, downloads CSV recordings, and replays them time-synced against a phone-recorded video. SwiftUI + CoreBluetooth + AVKit, no external dependencies.

Tabs (the first three match the desktop and Android tab order; **GPS**, **Rides**, and **GPS Debug** are iOS/watch additions):

- **Live** — when connected to a PumpLogger-firmware box (advertises as `STBoxFs`), renders the 0.5 Hz SensorStream snapshot: accel / gyro / mag / baro / GPS readouts + two `Canvas` sparklines (acc magnitude, pressure), topped by a **`BoardAnglesCard`** that reads the box attitude (pitch / roll / yaw in degrees, absolute + a zeroable calibration — see the *Live tab — board angles* section below). Subscription is automatic on Connect. Legacy PumpTsueri firmware doesn't expose the SensorStream characteristic — the tab stays empty with a status-line log entry.
- **Sync** — scan / connect / LIST / READ / DELETE / SET_MODE / GET_MODE / START_LOG / SET_TIME. Auto/Manual box log-mode (firmware v0.0.7+): `GET_MODE 0x07` on connect reflects the box's persisted mode, `SET_MODE 0x06` changes it, `START_LOG 0x05 [<dur:u32-LE>]` opens a fixed-duration manual session (no reboot/disconnect — only shown in manual mode). Single-byte SET/GET replies route through a `.modeReq` op. **GPS on/off (`GpsPowerSelector`, firmware v0.0.35+):** an On/Off control next to the log-mode selector turns the box's u-blox receiver off to save battery when GPS is faulty/unused — `GPS_POWER 0x11 [<u8 on>]` (off drops the receiver into UBX-RXM-PMREQ backup, ~tens of µA vs ~25 mA; persisted on the box + re-applied at boot) and `GPS_GET_POWER 0x12` (reflects the box's persisted state on connect). Both mirror SET_MODE/GET_MODE exactly — single-byte writes whose one-byte reply routes through a `.gpsPwrReq` op (the `.modeReq` twin, same 4 s `modeReqTimeoutMs`); `handleGpsPwrNotify` decodes it, `BleEvent.gpsPower(on:)` publishes it, and `FileSyncViewModel.queryGpsPower(attempt:)` is the idle-deferred connect-time query (the same self-deferring pattern as the firmware-version query). VM state is `gpsPowerOn: Bool?` (`nil` = unknown), toggled via `setGpsPower(_:)`. The box owns the persisted state; the app only reflects + sends. With GPS off, logging (IMU + baro) keeps running and Replay still time-aligns via the `# SYNC` anchor — you lose the speed + GPS-track panels but keep pitch/roll/height. Legacy firmware (< v0.0.35) ignores 0x11/0x12 → the op times out and the toggle stays "unknown" (neither button highlights). **`SET_TIME 0x08 [<epoch_ms:u64-LE>]` (firmware v0.0.10+)** is sent on **every connect**: the box has no RTC, so the phone hands it the current wall-clock millis and the firmware stamps a `# SYNC epoch_ms=… tick_ms=…` anchor line into the open `Sens*/Gps*.csv`, pairing the phone epoch with the box's free-running `ms` counter. This is what lets Replay time-align without a GPS fix (see CSV-schema + Replay notes below). Sent *fire-and-forget* (no tracked reply — legacy firmware without 0x08 just ignores the write); the epoch is sampled right before the send so it matches the box tick the firmware stamps. **Settle window (`BleClient.setTimeSettleMs = 2000`):** after `0x08` the firmware is busy appending the `# SYNC` line to SD and **silently drops the next FileCmd that arrives too soon** — confirmed on Android's wire trace, where a LIST ~0.5 s after SET_TIME timed out (20 s watchdog) but the same LIST ≥1.8 s later always succeeded (this bit hard in **Auto mode** where the user connects then immediately taps List). `sendSetTime` sets `setTimeSettleUntil = now() + setTimeSettleMs`; `handleCommand` `await`s `awaitCmdSettle()` before dispatching `.list/.read/.delete/.setLogMode/.getLogMode` — connection-control + SET_TIME itself never wait. So the first file command after a connect is held up to ~2 s instead of being swallowed. STOP_LOG/Disconnect buttons removed (always-on firmware). Downloaded files land in the app's `Documents/` (exposed in the Files app via `UIFileSharingEnabled` + `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`).
- **Replay** — pick a video (Photos picker OR a `.mov`/`.mp4`/`.m4v` already in `Documents/`) + a `Sens*.csv` + a `Gps*.csv` from the Sync tab's downloads, watch the four overlay panels (speed, pitch / Nasenwinkel, height above water, GPS track) update against the video playhead, then optionally export a V-stack composite MOV (source video on top, panels below with animated cursors) — the iOS equivalent of the desktop's `combined_*.mov`. The composite is saved to `Documents/combined_<basename>.mov` AND added to the Photos library.
- **Rides** — the Apple-Watch ride list (`RidesScreen`). Each row is one watch session's 1 Hz GPS CSV (synced over WatchConnectivity into `Documents/WatchRides/` by `WatchRideReceiver`). Tapping a row opens **`RideMapView`** (v1.0.23+), which plots the recorded track on an interactive Apple `Map` as **one continuous line coloured by inferred activity** — in-water swim / on-board / on-land walk (v1.0.24+) — and can export a **shareable PNG** — real map tiles under the activity-coloured track, start/end markers, a legend, and a branded footer (app logo + ride stats + the GitHub source link). See the *Rides tab — watch GPS on a map* section below. The raw CSV is still shareable straight from the row.

The Live tab observes the same `FileSyncViewModel` instance as Sync — `MainNav` owns it (`@State`) and passes a `@Bindable` reference to both tabs. The BLE client subscribes to FileData *and* SensorStream characteristics in parallel; the desktop's per-firmware advertise-name handling (`PumpTsueri` vs `STBoxFs`) is mirrored via `FileSyncProtocol.boxNames`. iOS auto-negotiates ATT MTU up to ~185 B at connect time, so the firmware delivers full 46-byte snapshots in a single notify; the 3-chunk reassembly path (sequence bytes 0x00/0x01/0x02) is implemented as a fallback but rarely triggers in practice.

The `stbox-viz/` Rust crate's board-3D animation and plotly HTML output stay desktop-only — the phone renders SwiftUI `Canvas` panels for live preview and uses `AVAssetExportSession` + `AVVideoCompositionCoreAnimationTool` for the offline composite export.

## Build & run

```sh
# CI-style compile check, no signing
xcodebuild -project MovementLogger.xcodeproj -scheme MovementLogger \
    -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -configuration Debug \
    build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

# Signed build for device (uses keychain identity for team 4B37356EGR)
xcodebuild -project MovementLogger.xcodeproj -scheme MovementLogger \
    -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -configuration Debug \
    -allowProvisioningUpdates build

# Find connected device and install
xcrun devicectl list devices               # grab the iPhone identifier
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <UUID> \
    ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MovementLogger-*/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/MovementLogger.app
xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <UUID> ch.pumptsueri.movementlogger
```

The phone must be **unlocked** when `devicectl install` runs (iOS needs to mount the developer disk image). If the install fails with `kAMDMobileImageMounterDeviceLocked`, unlock the screen and retry.

Targets: iOS 17.0+, universal (iPhone + iPad). Bundle id `ch.pumptsueri.movementlogger`. Marketing version is bumped via the target's Debug + Release `MARKETING_VERSION` settings.

## Signing

`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = 4B37356EGR` (ywesee GmbH). Local Xcode dev still uses `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic`. **CI signs MANUALLY** (overridden on the `xcodebuild` command line): the old automatic flow used `-allowProvisioningUpdates` + the App Store Connect API key, which makes Xcode mint a *new managed certificate on every clean runner*. Apple caps certificates per account, so after enough releases the cap is hit and Archive fails with "Your account has reached the maximum number of certificates" (this is what broke iOS v0.0.15 — not a code issue). Manual signing pins the one fixed `APPLE_CERT_P12_BASE64` distribution cert + a fixed App Store provisioning profile (`APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`), and drops `-allowProvisioningUpdates`, so CI never creates certificates. Apple API credentials for the team live at `~/.apple/credentials.json` + `~/.apple/AuthKey_*.p8` (still used only for the `altool` upload, which does not create certs).

**Duplicate Apple Distribution certs gotcha.** The keychain has three `Apple Distribution: ywesee GmbH (4B37356EGR)` entries (expired 2022, expired 2024, current expires 2027). Xcode auto-picks the latest, but anything that exports by CN alone (e.g. `security export -t identities`, a naive PEM-split script) may grab the FIRST match — which is the expired 2022 one. The CI cert-bundle in `APPLE_CERT_P12_BASE64` was rebuilt to disambiguate by `notAfter` and pick the latest. If you ever need to re-roll the cert secret, use the same disambiguation (sort candidates by `notAfter`, take the last).

## Release (tag-driven CI)

**Versioning policy — REVISED 11.7.2026: the 0.0.x TestFlight train is dead.**
Apple rejects ANY upload (TestFlight included) whose
`CFBundleShortVersionString` is lower than the last APPROVED store version
(error 90062, hit when v0.0.31 tried to upload against approved 1.0.23).
Everything now rides the `1.x.x` train: every tag uploads to TestFlight
(usable by internal testers as soon as processing finishes, independent of
review) and auto-submits to the App Store. The historical split below is
kept for context only — do NOT tag 0.0.x anymore.

**Historical policy (obsolete, pre-11.7.2026):**
- **`0.0.x` = binary / TestFlight builds** — bumped per dev iteration, installed to the phone over USB (`devicectl`) and/or uploaded to App Store Connect for TestFlight, but **never auto-submitted** to the public App Store. These are what I bump+install while iterating (currently 0.0.30).
- **`1.x.x+` = public App Store releases** — the only tags that auto-submit for review. Recent store/TestFlight builds run on the 1.0.x train (last tagged **1.0.17**; Watch water-temp work bumped source through 1.0.22 untagged). This release (Rides-tab watch-GPS map + shareable PNG) is **1.0.23** (the App Store version string must be > the live one, and a build's `CFBundleShortVersionString` must match the store version it's submitted under, so a store build is literally built as `1.0.x`, not `0.0.x`).
- The workflow gates the submit-for-review step on `MAJOR >= 1` (`steps.ver.outputs.store`), so a `0.0.x` tag builds + uploads but stops before publishing, and only a `v1.x.x` tag actually goes to the store. The auto-submit (`scripts/submit_for_review.py`) sets `releaseType=AFTER_APPROVAL` (auto-publish on Apple's approval — the iOS analogue of Android's `--track production --release-status completed`) and answers export-compliance via `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` in Info.plist. Apple still requires human review (~1 day); no API skips it.

Push `vX.Y.Z` → CI builds, signs, uploads to App Store Connect, and cuts a GitHub release with the IPA attached. Workflow lives at `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Trigger:

```sh
git tag v0.0.6
git push origin v0.0.6
```

The workflow parses the tag (`v0.0.6` → version `0.0.6`, build `6` from the patch component), sed-patches `MARKETING_VERSION` / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` into the pbxproj at build time (so the source on the tagged commit doesn't need to be re-bumped), then runs `xcodebuild archive` → `xcodebuild -exportArchive` → `xcrun altool --upload-app` → `gh release create`. **Manual signing**: the imported `.p12` identity is discovered from the keychain (`SIGN_IDENTITY`), the App Store profile is decoded + installed and its `Name` read with PlistBuddy (`PROFILE_NAME`), both passed explicitly to `xcodebuild` (`CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual`) and into `ExportOptions.plist` (`signingStyle=manual`). No `-allowProvisioningUpdates`.

Required GitHub Actions secrets (set once via `gh secret set --repo zdavatz/movement_logger_ios`):

- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_P8_BASE64` — base64 of `~/.apple/AuthKey_<id>.p8` (upload only)
- `APPLE_CERT_P12_BASE64` — base64 of slim single-identity `.p12` for `Apple Distribution: ywesee GmbH (4B37356EGR)` (NOT a full keychain export — those exceed GitHub's secret size limit)
- `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` — **(manual signing)** base64 of the App Store **distribution** `.mobileprovision` for `ch.pumptsueri.movementlogger` (Apple Developer portal → Profiles → create an App Store profile bound to the `APPLE_CERT_P12_BASE64` cert, download, `base64 -i profile.mobileprovision`). Re-roll whenever the distribution cert is re-rolled.
- `APPLE_WATCH_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` — **(added v1.0.23, for the embedded Watch app)** base64 of the App Store distribution `.mobileprovision` for `ch.pumptsueri.movementlogger.watchkitapp`, bound to the **same** distribution cert. The build embeds the Apple Watch app, so its bundle id needs its OWN profile — the main-app profile can't sign it (Archive fails: *"app ID … does not match bundle ID …watchkitapp"* + missing HealthKit / Shallow-Depth entitlements). Generate with `scripts/create_watch_profile.py create` (reads the cert from the main-app CI profile so both match) and `gh secret set APPLE_WATCH_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`. Re-roll whenever the distribution cert is re-rolled. **Per-target signing: `xcodebuild archive` accepts only ONE `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER` on the CLI, and manual signing does NOT auto-select installed profiles — so a CI-only step (`scripts/ci_manual_signing.py`, via the `pbxproj` lib) writes `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual` + each target's own `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER` into the app and Watch targets' Release build settings before Archive.** That edit is never committed (local dev keeps Automatic); the Archive step then passes no signing overrides, and Export pins both bundle ids in `ExportOptions.plist`. Verified end-to-end on a throwaway `v0.0.99` tag (Archive + Export succeeded). (Store submission of a Watch-containing build ALSO needs an `APP_WATCH_SERIES_4` 368×448 screenshot — see the screenshots section / `scripts/upload_store_screenshots.py`.)

Canonical backup of the slim Apple Distribution `.p12` + its password sits in `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ywesee/p12/apple_distribution_ios.{p12,password.txt}` (re-encrypted with modern AES-256 instead of the RC2-40 default that `security export` produces; OpenSSL 3 refuses to read the latter without `-legacy`).

## App Store assets (screenshots, previews, icon)

The full App Store asset workflow — screenshot resize/upload (incl. the
`APP_WATCH_SERIES_4` 368×448 requirement), 15–30 s app-preview video
transcodes, and app-icon regeneration, with all the dimension/format gotchas —
now lives in the **`store-assets` skill** (`.claude/skills/store-assets/SKILL.md`)
so it loads only when you're doing store-submission work. Invoke it then.

## Architecture

The Swift file layout is derivable — `find MovementLogger -name '*.swift'`, or
just read the files. The subsections below document the parts that AREN'T
obvious from the tree: the non-trivial per-tab behaviors, fusion pipeline, and
BLE/OTA/GPS-debug state machines.

### Live tab — board angles

`LiveScreen.BoardAnglesCard` sits at the top of the Live tab and shows the box attitude in degrees about the box's **physical** axes, computed by `BoardAngles.from(rows:nosePlusY:biasDeg:)` (in `BLE/LiveSample.swift`) from the drift-free gyro+accel `OrientationFilter` `OriRows` — the SAME attitude source that drives the 3D preview, NOT the per-sample raw-accel formulas.

- **Fixes a real bug.** The old "Angles (°)" row in the readout grid used phone-style accel formulas (long axis = X). This box's NOSE is the **Y** axis, so those formulas SWAPPED pitch and roll. That row was removed; `BoardAngles` decouples the three about the physical axes so the labels are literally correct: **Pitch = nose up/down (uphill/downhill)**, **Roll = lean onto the left/right side (bank about the nose)**, **Yaw = heading**. Each is a single decoupled physical quantity (not a coupled Euler triple), so the signs stay individually predictable at the modest angles a foil sees — side-stepping the gimbal / axis-order pitfalls a matrix→Euler decomposition would reintroduce.
- **Two readouts.** *Absolute* passes the real heading bias (`vm.headingBiasDeg`, so yaw is a compass heading). *Calibrated* is a tare: **"Zero here"** (`vm.zeroBoardAngles()`) captures the current pose as the reference, and the calibrated set then shows deviation from that mounted reference; **"Clear"** (`clearBoardAngleZero()`) resets. A "zeroed M:SS ago" note shows how stale the tare is. The tared yaw is sampled at `biasDeg: 0` so turn-since-zero is independent of the direction calibration; pitch/roll are bias-invariant, so both readouts agree on them.
- **The zero reference persists** across reconnect / app-restart via `AgentConfig.angleZeroRef` (`[pitch, roll, yaw]°`) + `angleZeroAtEpoch` (UserDefaults). The VM mirrors those into `angleZeroRef` / `angleZeroAt` at init and rewrites both on every zero/clear.

### Sync tab — BLE FileSync

- `BLE/FileSyncProtocol.swift` mirrors the Kotlin port one-for-one. Authoritative spec is the firmware's `ble_filesync.c`; the Rust client's `ble.rs` and the Kotlin `FileSyncProtocol.kt` are reference host implementations.
- `BLE/BleClient.swift` — single-worker state machine. CoreBluetooth delegate callbacks (on a dedicated serial `DispatchQueue`) marshal raw events into one `AsyncStream<WorkerEvent>`; a single `Task` consumes from that stream and holds `CurrentOp` (`.idle` / `.listing` / `.reading` / `.deleting`). Watchdog ticks every 200 ms are posted into the same stream so op-state mutation stays single-tasked without locks.
- `UI/FileSyncScreen.swift` — SwiftUI binds to an `@Observable` view-model that consumes `ble.events` (an `AsyncStream<BleEvent>`). Bluetooth permission is requested implicitly via the `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` build setting — iOS prompts the first time `CBCentralManager` is instantiated. Downloaded files land in `Documents/` under the original filename; `UIFileSharingEnabled` + `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` surface them in the system Files app under "On My iPhone → MovementLogger".

**Sync vs. transfer (SQLite-tracked).** The Sync tab has two distinct operations, mirroring `movement_logger_desktop` (issues #3/#4): per-file **Download** (manual one-off transfer, unchanged) and **Sync now** (pull every session file on the SD card not already mirrored locally, and remember what was pulled). `BLE/SyncDb.swift` is the iOS port of the desktop's `stbox-viz-gui/src/sync_db.rs` — same `synced_files` schema, primary key `(box_id, name, size)` (`size` in the key on purpose: a regrown file with the same name re-pulls). `box_id` = `CBPeripheral.identifier.uuidString`, captured on `.connected`. DB lives at `<Application Support>/sqlite/sync.db` — anchored there, *not* `Documents/` (which is user-deletable via the Files app; the desktop's analogue is "anchored to $HOME, not the download folder"), in its own `sqlite/` subdir per desktop issue #4. Uses the system `SQLite3` module (no external dependency, no Frameworks-build-phase change — autolinked). **Live-mirror model (desktop v0.0.14):** `Documents/<name>` *is* the running mirror — downloads append straight into it (no `.part`/rename). `READ` carries a u32-LE byte offset (`0x02 + name + 0x00 + offset`); `mirrorOffset` decides per file by **local size vs box size** (local<box → fetch only the tail from `offset=local`; local==box → up to date; local>box → rotated, drop & refetch), so a continuously-growing log only pulls its delta and no big file starves GPS/BAT in the serial queue. The SQLite DB is now an **audit log only** (`isSynced` removed), not the fetch decision. **"Keep synced"** toggle: while connected + idle, re-runs a sync pass every 30 s (`syncPollTask`). Flow: `syncNow()`/keep-synced → `startSyncPass` sets a pending flag → fresh LIST → `.listDone` runs the diff *only* when the flag is set (so the auto-LIST never syncs) → `isSensorData` files behind their mirror drain serially through the single-op `startRead()` path via `pumpSyncQueue` (drained from `.readDone`, which `appendMirror`s the segment at `base` and `markSynced`s for the audit log). **Serial manual downloads:** per-file **Download** taps go through a separate `manualQueue`/`pumpManualQueue` over the same `startRead` — `download()` is a *queue entry* (dedupe + append + publish names into `queuedDownloads` so the row shows **Queued**), and `pumpManualQueue` issues the next READ only when fully idle (`!listing && downloads.isEmpty && syncInFlight == nil && fwUpload == nil && !briefOpInFlight && connected`), re-pumped from `.readDone`/`.listDone`/`.deleteDone`/`.logMode`/`.error`. Before this, a second Download tap while a big file streamed was rejected by the worker ("another op in flight") and the row stuck forever. `briefOpInFlight` covers the brief single-ops not in UI state (DELETE, GET/SET mode) so a Delete-then-Download double-tap can't collide. Mirrors Android `FileSyncCore` exactly. **Lossless resume (desktop v0.0.9):** a link drop / 20 s stall mid-READ emits `.readAborted(name, content, base)`; the VM appends that partial into the mirror (not `markSynced` — incomplete) and sets `transferInterrupted`, which shows an amber banner on the disconnected screen and, on the next `.connected`, auto-runs a sync pass that skips every complete file and re-pulls only the unfinished one from its mirror offset. So a shielded/out-of-range interruption is never lossy. **Bounded auto-reconnect (desktop v0.0.11–13):** on a mid-READ remote drop *or* a 20 s watchdog stall (box still nominally connected — no formal disconnect), `BleClient` arms a tick-driven reconnect state machine (`reconnect`/`tickReconnect`): up to 10 rounds of refresh-scan → `central.connect`, each bounded; suppresses the public `.disconnected` while retrying; subscribe-confirmed clears it and the re-emitted `.connected` drives the mirror-resume. Exhaustion → `.disconnected` + the amber banner (still lossless via the mirror). A user-initiated Disconnect clears the reconnect target so it doesn't bounce back. **Policy (locked, user decision): sync is purely additive — it never issues DELETE.** Only `Sens*/Gps*/Bat*.csv` + `Mic*.wav` are auto-synced; FW_INFO / CHK / error logs stay manual-only. Android (`ble/SyncDb.kt`, `SQLiteDatabase` direct, `filesDir/sqlite/sync.db`, box_id = BLE MAC) is the exact peer.

**Background BLE.** `UIBackgroundModes = bluetooth-central` (Info.plist) lets CoreBluetooth callbacks continue firing when the app is backgrounded — so a long READ keeps streaming bytes while the user switches to another app. To survive the quiet moments between BLE notifications (post-START_LOG 500 ms wait, LIST inactivity terminator, gaps between READ chunks), `BleClient` also holds a `UIApplication.beginBackgroundTask` assertion across the whole connected session — begins on `.connected`, ends on `disconnectInner` / `close`. Without that assertion, the `Task.sleep` calls inside the worker (watchdog tick, post-START_LOG delay) would freeze when iOS suspends the runloop. With it, ongoing BLE traffic keeps re-extending the assertion and the session stays alive in the background indefinitely. Scanning is intentionally NOT supported in the background — `centralManager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil)` requires the foreground, and the user is always tapping Scan in the UI anyway.

### Background sync agent

Port of Android's `sync/` (`BackgroundSync.kt`+`SyncWorker.kt`) and the desktop's `--agent` mode — but mapped to iOS's two background mechanisms because iOS does NOT allow Android-style periodic background work for arbitrary jobs.

**Two layered mechanisms:**

1. **CoreBluetooth State Preservation & Restoration.** `BleClient`'s `CBCentralManager` is constructed with `CBCentralManagerOptionRestoreIdentifierKey = "ch.pumptsueri.movementlogger.ble"`. iOS will relaunch the app in the background — *even from terminated state*, *even after a phone reboot* — when the previously-connected box reconnects in range or fires a notification on a subscribed characteristic. `centralManager(_:willRestoreState:)` picks up the restored `[CBPeripheral]`, re-attaches our delegate, rebinds `cmdChar/dataChar/streamChar`, and re-emits `.connected` if the link is already up. This is the **primary** wake-up path — most reliable, no scheduler magic, fires when the user is actually near the box.

2. **`BGAppRefreshTask`.** `Sync/BackgroundSync.swift` registers task identifier `ch.pumptsueri.movementlogger.sync` (matched by `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` in Info.plist) and submits `BGAppRefreshTaskRequest`s with a 15-min `earliestBeginDate` hint. **iOS owns the actual cadence** — it fires opportunistically based on usage patterns, doesn't fire at all if the user never opens the app, and skips during Low Power Mode. Handler in `Sync/SyncTaskHandler.swift`: re-arms the next slot first → gates on `AgentConfig.active` → checks `FileSyncViewModel.shared.isBusy` (GUI-wins) → `vm.connect(identifier: savedUUID)` → polls until `Sync: complete` or `Sync: up to date` → `vm.disconnect()` → `setTaskCompleted`. Slot budget is ~25 s; `expirationHandler` tears the link down if iOS reclaims early.

**Registration order matters.** `BGTaskScheduler.register(forTaskWithIdentifier:)` MUST be called **before `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` returns** or iOS drops the identifier and the handler never fires. SwiftUI's `App` lifecycle doesn't expose a synchronous pre-launch hook, so `MovementLoggerApp.swift` uses `UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self)` and calls `BackgroundSync.register()` from the delegate. The same hook also touches `FileSyncViewModel.shared` so the `CBCentralManager` (with its restoration identifier) is constructed before iOS has a chance to deliver `willRestoreState` — SwiftUI evaluates the root view lazily and that's too late.

**Config persistence.** `Sync/AgentConfig.swift` (iOS UserDefaults wrapper) is the iOS peer of Android's `AgentConfig.kt` (SharedPreferences) and the desktop's `~/.movementlogger/config.toml`. Three keys: `boxId` (`CBPeripheral.identifier.uuidString`), `keepSynced` (Bool), `logModeManual` (tri-state — `nil` / `false` / `true`, encoded via a separate `_known` companion bit because UserDefaults has no native tri-state Boolean — same trick as Android). `FileSyncViewModel` is the only writer; the BG handler is the only out-of-app reader.

**Gating (locked, do not change without re-confirming with Peter/Zeno):** `keepSynced && boxId != nil && logModeManual != true` — MANUAL mode disables the schedule (the user controls when the box logs); AUTO + Keep-synced + known box enables it. `logModeManual == nil` (unknown / legacy firmware) is treated as not-manual so old PumpTsueri builds still participate. Identical to Android `AgentConfig.active` and desktop `cfg.keep_synced && cfg.log_mode_manual != Some(true)`.

**Coordination — GUI wins, agent yields** (decided architecture, kept verbatim from Android/desktop): both the foreground UI and the BG handler grab the **same** `FileSyncViewModel.shared` → same `BleClient` → same `CBCentralManager`. The handler checks `vm.isBusy` (connected OR any in-flight op) and yields with `setTaskCompleted(success: true)` if the foreground is active. There is no separate IPC lock (unlike the desktop, which uses fs4 advisory locks for its multi-process GUI/agent split) — iOS's two paths share an address space so they observe the same `@Observable` state directly.

**Schedule refresh triggers.** `FileSyncViewModel` calls `BackgroundSync.refresh()` from three places (gating may have flipped): `.connected` (boxId now known), `setKeepSynced(_:)` (user toggle), and `.logMode(manual:)` (AUTO ↔ MANUAL changes). Plus once on cold launch from `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` (in case the app was killed while the schedule was supposed to be live).

**What iOS *cannot* do** (vs Android/desktop):
- No equivalent of Android's WorkManager's "every 15 min, guaranteed" — `BGAppRefreshTask` is opportunistic; iOS schedules it when *iOS* sees fit, not on a wall clock.
- No `BOOT_COMPLETED` autostart — iOS apps cannot start themselves on device boot. Restoration covers the "user opened the app at least once" case (iOS remembers the registered identifier across reboots), but a *fresh* install only starts mirroring once the user opens the app once. Matches Android's behaviour: a fresh install does nothing until the user goes through the foreground Connect → Keep-synced flow.
- No headless background scanning. `central.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil)` returns nothing in BG and `withServices: [...]` needs the parent service UUID (which the firmware doesn't expose under a standard service). We instead rely on `central.retrievePeripherals(withIdentifiers: [savedUUID])` + `central.connect(...)`, which iOS will fulfil when the box appears.

### Sync UI — visible-progress card

While a sync pass is draining, `FileSyncScreen.SyncProgressRow` sits under the keep-synced toggle and shows two layers of progress:

- **Headline**: cumulative bytes (`X MB / Y MB`), overall percent, and "N of M files" — derived from `syncCumulativeBytes / syncPassTotalBytes`. `syncPassTotalBytes` is the sum of every queued file's `size`; `syncCumulativeBytes` is the sum of completed-files' sizes + the in-flight file's `bytesDone`. The bar advances continuously as bytes arrive over BLE.
- **Current file**: filename + per-file byte progress + per-file bar. Refreshes whenever the queue advances to the next file.

This exists because the file list above the progress card is *deliberately empty* during a sync (the VM clears `files` at `startSyncPass` and only repopulates after `.listDone`), so without a separate progress affordance the user would have no signal that keep-synced was actually doing anything. The card is shown whenever `vm.syncing == true` — both `Sync now` taps AND the 30 s `Keep synced` poll.

**"List files" and "Sync now" are disabled while any worker op is in flight** (`listing || syncing || !downloads.isEmpty`). Without this guard, a tap during a slow READ would surface the BLE worker's `another op is in flight` rejection and look like the tap did nothing.

### Sync race-conditions worth remembering

- **Post-`.connected` sync kick is deferred 500 ms.** When restoration or a reconnect fires `.connected`, the VM sends `getLogMode` *and* (if keep-synced was on) calls `startSyncPass`. Without a defer, the LIST inside `startSyncPass` would collide with the in-flight `modeReq` and be rejected as "another op is in flight". `Task { try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(500)); startSyncPass(...) }` lets the modeReq reply land first. Idle paths still serialise correctly: the deferred task checks `connection == .connected && !syncing` before kicking.
- **"another op is in flight" is a benign collision, NOT a sync abort.** The original `.error` handler nuked the queue and surfaced a "Sync aborted (BLE error) — try again" banner on any error. Now: `isCollision = msg.hasPrefix("another op is in flight")` short-circuits before the abort path. If `syncing == true` but the queue is empty AND nothing is in-flight (the just-started case), we additionally reset `syncing = false` so the next 30 s tick retries; an active drain is left alone (the in-flight READ keeps going, the colliding command was the new one, not the running one).
- **Don't pump a READ into a reconnecting (dead) link — the orphaned-download stall (v1.0.5).** `armReconnect` suppresses the public `.disconnected` to keep the UI on the connected screen, so the VM still reads `connection == .connected` while the link is actually down. The pre-v1.0.5 bug: a mid-transfer drop → `.error("READ … aborted")` → `pumpManualQueue`/`pumpSyncQueue` issued the *next* queued READ; `startRead` optimistically set `downloads[name]` and then the write failed "not connected", leaving a phantom progress row that never cleared and blocked the queue forever (the "BAT011 hangs partially" report, confirmed in the box's `movement_logger.log` pulled over USB: `READ BAT011 @14506/34572` immediately followed by `ERROR: not connected`). Fix: `BleClient.armReconnect` emits a new `.reconnecting` event **before** `disconnectInner` (so it lands ahead of the `.readAborted`/`.error`); the VM sets a `reconnecting` flag, clears optimistic `downloads`, and both pumps gate on `!reconnecting`. Cleared by the next `.connected` (success) / `.disconnected` (exhausted). The resume sync pass re-pulls from the mirror offset.
- **`startRead` returns whether it issued a READ (v1.0.5).** An already-fully-mirrored queued file (`mirrorOffset >= size`) issues no READ, so there's no `.readDone` to re-pump — the old early-`return` silently stranded the queue (in the sync queue `syncInFlight` stuck on that file; "advances to next item but doesn't continue"). Now `@discardableResult startRead -> Bool`; both pumps loop past non-issuing files (the sync pump folds their bytes into the progress total) and stop on the first real READ.
- **`GET_MODE`/`SET_MODE` time out in 4 s, not 20 s (`modeReqTimeoutMs`, v1.0.5).** A box that never answers `0x07` (legacy/old firmware) used to hold the single-op worker for the full 20 s `opIdleTimeoutMs`, during which every `List files` tap collided — the real cause of "List does nothing for ~20 s after connect" (NOT the SET_TIME settle). The dedicated short timeout frees the worker fast.
- **Big-file drops after minutes are a BOX-firmware problem, not the iOS app.** The drop is a BLE LL supervision timeout (`CBError` "connection timed out unexpectedly"), and the `GET_MODE` silence is the box ignoring `0x07`. Both mean the box runs firmware older than `movement_logger_firmware` v0.0.17, which has the connection-stability fixes (45 s READ stall tolerance; the aggressive 4 s-supervision-timeout conn-param request disabled) and answers `GET_MODE`. The IWDG watchdog is NOT the cause — the READ runs as a main-loop-pumped state machine (`fsm_advance`, one ~244 B chunk per `BLE_Tick`) so the 8 s IWDG is fed between chunks. Fix: flash the box with the latest firmware (BLE FOTA from the desktop app's `--flash-firmware`, or DFU). See `movement_logger_firmware`.

### Firmware OTA (box FOTA over BLE)

Two entry points on the Sync tab, both driving the same `FW_BEGIN → FW_DATA… → FW_COMMIT` state machine in `BleClient` (`0x09/0x0A/0x0B`, `0x0C` abort):

- **"🔄 New box firmware vX available" banner** (v1.0.12) — the one-tap path. `startFirmwareCheck` runs on `.connected`: it queries GitHub (`FirmwareUpdate.checkLatest`, newest `firmware-v*.bin` release on `zdavatz/movement_logger_firmware`) AND the box version (`GET_VERSION 0x10`, firmware v0.0.29+; legacy boxes never reply → treated as "unknown → offer update"). If the latest release is newer (or the box version is unknown) the banner shows. "Update box" (`applyFirmwareUpdate`) **downloads the `.bin` from GitHub in-app** and hands the bytes straight to the OTA flow — the user never touches a file. During that GitHub download there is no OTA bar yet (it starts at `FW_BEGIN`).
- **"Upload firmware (.bin)"** button — the manual path: a file picker over `.bin`s already in the Files app. Only this one needs a local file.

Two v1.0.13 fixes, both found by pulling the box-side `movement_logger.log` over USB while an OTA crawled:

- **Progress bar stuck at 0 % — iOS-only bug.** `handleFwData` bumped the emit-watermark (`lastEmit`) on *every* ACK, so `done - lastEmit` never accumulated to the throttle threshold and `fwUploadProgress` only fired on the final byte — the bar sat at 0 % then jumped to 100 %. **Android (the reference) advances the watermark only inside the emit `if`; desktop emits every chunk (no throttle) — so neither has this bug.** Fixed to only advance `lastEmit` when it actually emits, and dropped `fwProgressChunkBytes` 2 KB → 512 B so a slow transfer visibly moves.
- **FW_DATA resend tuned for dropped ACKs: `fwDataTimeoutMs` 5 s → 1.5 s, `fwMaxRetries` 5 → 12.** The OTA is ACK-gated (one chunk out, wait for the box's 4-byte next-offset reply, resend the SAME chunk on timeout — the box is idempotent for `offset < cursor`, so a resend just re-ACKs, never a bad-seq). On old box firmware the ACK notify is periodically *dropped* (not merely slow), and only the resend unsticks it — so the whole transfer paced at the 5 s timeout (~140 B/s, ~12 min for 106 KB, looked frozen). All three platforms share this exact design and timeout family — **desktop `FW_DATA_TIMEOUT` 5 s / 5 retries, Android `FW_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_MS` 4 s / 5 — so they crawl the same way on a flaky link.** iOS now recovers a lost ACK in 1.5 s (~3× faster, ~3–4 min), keeping ~18 s total per-chunk tolerance (1.5 s × 12) so a genuine multi-second box stall still rides through. Worth backporting the shorter timeout to desktop/Android.
- **`FW_BEGIN: box busy (0xB0)` after an interrupted upload.** Killing the app (or reinstalling) mid-OTA leaves the box's FW staging session open; the next `FW_BEGIN` is rejected BUSY until the box is power-cycled (or a future `FW_ABORT`-before-`FW_BEGIN` self-heal is added). Not a logging conflict when the box is in Manual/idle mode.

### Throughput (carried over from desktop + Android)

PumpTsueri FileSync delivers ~**1.8–2 KB/s** in practice. Measured from real downloads: SENS001 (91 KB) in 46 s, SENS002 (188 KB) in 102 s — same on iOS, Android, and desktop. The bottleneck is the firmware notify pacing + SD-card read rate, not host-side queueing. iOS already auto-negotiates the maximum MTU (~185 B) and the BLE protocol is **single-op by design** (one FileCmd + one FileData characteristic, no multiplexing — a second READ during one in flight is rejected by the firmware with `BUSY (0xB0)`), so parallel transfers are not possible and would not help if they were. A 2 MB sensor file takes ~17 min. Live-mirror + incremental sync (next pass fetches only the new tail) is what makes day-to-day use bearable: only the *first* sync of an old session is slow.

### Replay tab — data on top of video

`ReplayViewModel` keeps the parsed sensor/GPS as `fullSensorRows`/`fullGpsRows` (`@ObservationIgnored` backing storage). On any pick (sensor, GPS, video), `applyVideoAndSlice()` runs and:

1. Picks the **alignment date** from the video's `creation_time` if loaded, else today. This replaces the v1 "today's date" assumption — without it, sensor data recorded on a different day from when the user opens the app would land 24h+ off and the cursor would never move.
2. Re-parses each GPS row's `hhmmss.ss` against that date → `fullGpsAbsTimesMs`.
3. Builds `fullSensorAbsTimesMs` by **piecewise-linear interpolation across the FULL GPS (tick → utcMs) anchor pairs** (mirroring `animate_cmd.rs`'s GPS-anchored time-alignment). v1 extrapolated from a single anchor at a fixed 10 ms/tick and accumulated ~7 s of drift over a 21-min session — that's enough to desync the cursor on Pitch/Height panels visibly. Earlier iOS versions did this on the **already-sliced** gpsRows (often empty when the video falls outside GPS coverage), which produced an all-zero array and broke abs-time slicing entirely. Doing the interpolation pre-slice lets the slice operate on real wall-clock values even when the video's window is past the GPS coverage end.
4. **Slices sensor + GPS by ABSOLUTE TIME** against `[video.creation_time, +duration]`. Both arrays get sliced independently, so different videos from the same long session pick out different sub-ranges (key for sessions where you record many short videos against one continuous box log).
5. **Empty-slice fallback** — when the video window falls entirely outside the sensor's covered time (evening video against a morning-only sensor session), show the FULL session instead of nothing. `rideSlicingSummary` includes "video outside sensor coverage" so the user understands why.
6. **Cursor-sweep fallback** — when (a) there are no usable GPS anchors at all OR (b) we just fell back to the full session in step 5, the abs-time arrays are linearly stretched across the video duration via `linearAbsTimes(...)`. This keeps the red cursor sweeping cleanly 0% → 100% of the panel during playback, instead of parking at the last index because target=`videoCreation+playhead` lies past the last UTC value.

Once sensor data exists, `maybeComputeFusion()` runs the full pipeline on a detached `Task.userInitiated`:

1. `Fusion.detectDtSeconds` → sample rate
2. `Fusion.computeQuaternions` (β = 0.1, matches `animate_cmd.rs:78`)
3. `Fusion.noseAngleSeriesDeg` — 1 s + 60 s rolling-median drift correction. `GpsMath.rollingMedian` dispatches to a sorted-array fast path for windows ≥ 32 / inputs ≥ 64 (the 60 s × 100 Hz = 6000-sample baseline would be unusable on the simple O(n·w·log w) path).
4. `Baro.heightAboveWaterM` — GPS-anchored water reference, falls back to session-max pressure when no stationary anchors exist
5. `FusionHeight.fusedHeightM` — α-β complementary baro + body→world-rotated acc

**Sensor-only / GPS-only rendering.** The pipeline runs as long as **sensorRows is non-empty** — `Baro.heightAboveWaterM` already falls back to session-max pressure when GPS is empty, so Pitch + Height panels render from sensor alone. Speed + GPS track panels render from GPS alone (no sensor needed). The Export gate accepts ANY data series — sensor-only produces a 2-panel composite (Pitch + Height), GPS-only produces a 2-panel composite (Speed + GPS track), full sessions produce the 4-panel composite. `CompositeExporter.activePanelKinds(_:)` filters the panel slots and the output height auto-shrinks (`panelHeight × activeCount`) so there are no empty rectangles in the .mov.

**Video → CSV auto-pick.** `pickVideo()` runs `autoPickMatchingCsvs(referenceMs:)` after slicing — scoring every `Sens*.csv` and `Gps*.csv` in `Documents/` by filename token overlap (e.g. video `Ayano_Pump_25.4.2026_Ermioni.MOV` ↔ `Sens_ayano_25.4.2026.csv` share `ayano`, `25`, `4`, `2026`), falling back to mod-date proximity within ±7 days when filenames are generic (`Sens001.csv` vs `IMG_4022.mov` share no tokens). `Self.fileTokens(_:)` lowercases, strips the extension, splits on `_- .,()[]{}/`, drops noise tokens (`sens`, `gps`, `bat`, `iphonegps`, `mov`, `csv`, `mp4`, `m4v`, `img`, `video`, `log`, `data`, `ble`). The picked match is published to `autoPickSummary` ("auto-pick: Sens → SENS002.CSV · GPS → GPS002.CSV") and rendered in `LoadedStatusBar` so the user can immediately see what was wired through. Reference time is `meta.creationTimeMillis ?? fileModMillis(url)` so the picker works even on re-encoded clips that lost their `creation_time` tag.

**LoadedStatusBar (in `ReplayScreen`).** Sits directly under the Pick/Replace video button, ABOVE the long file picker — so the green ✓ on Sensor / GPS / Video is visible at a glance without scrolling. Without it the only feedback after Load was a tinted row in the file list + a row-count line under ExportRow far below, easy to miss.

Video metadata read via `AVAsset.commonMetadata` for `commonKeyCreationDate`, falling back to `loadMetadata(for: .quickTimeMetadata/.iTunesMetadata/...)` for action-cam containers. Displayed dimensions (`displayedSize`) are computed from `naturalSize × preferredTransform` so the SwiftUI `VideoPlayer` can lock the correct aspect ratio — without that, portrait clips collapse to zero height.

Panels (all SwiftUI `Canvas`, all bound to a 33 ms playhead poll from `AVPlayer.currentTime()`):

- **Speed** — `GpsMath.smoothSpeedKmh` (clip > 60 km/h, linear-interp gaps, 5-sample rolling median).
- **Pitch / Nasenwinkel** — `noseAngleSeriesDeg`, symmetric ±max scaling around zero.
- **Height** — overlay of raw baro (thin grey) and fused (thick primary).
- **GPS track** — lat/lon with `cos(meanLat)` longitude correction; moving red dot at the playhead.

Each panel takes its own absolute-time array (`gpsAbsTimesMs` or `sensorAbsTimesMs`) and binary-searches the cursor index from `videoMeta.creationTimeMillis + playheadMs`. When the video has no creation_time, cursors hide.

**Video picker**: two paths. `PhotosPicker` + a `VideoFile: Transferable` shim that imports via `FileRepresentation(contentType: .movie)` and copies into `temporaryDirectory`. OR a "Video (in Files)" section in `RecordingPicker` that lists `.mov`/`.mp4`/`.m4v` files already in `Documents/` (filtered to hide `combined_*` exports). The Files path is what you want when pushing clips via `xcrun devicectl device copy to` rather than going through Photos.

### Replay tab — composite MOV export

`CompositeExporter.export(_:to:progress:)` builds a V-stack composite: source video on top, four data panels (Speed / Pitch / Height / GPS track) stacked below, with the red cursor sweeps and GPS dot animated via `CAKeyframeAnimation` tied to `AVCoreAnimationBeginTimeAtZero`. H.264 .mov at `1080 × (videoH + 4×320)`, written to `Documents/combined_<basename>.mov` and also added to the Photos library via `PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges { … addResource(with: .video, fileURL:) }` (requires `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`).

Built on **`AVAssetExportSession` + `AVVideoCompositionCoreAnimationTool`** — the OS-managed parallel pipeline with the hardware H.264 encoder. End-to-end ~30-50 s for a 39-s 1080×3200 clip on iPhone 17 Pro Max.

**Live value labels** in each panel (mirroring the Android Replay screen's "now X.X" / "fused +X.XX m" top-left stack) come from a `LiveValueLayer: CALayer` subclass. Its `@NSManaged var frameIndex: CGFloat` is animated 0 → numFrames−1 across the video duration via a `CAKeyframeAnimation`; CA's render pass calls `display()` once per output frame, which reads `presentation().frameIndex`, indexes into a precomputed per-frame `[Double]` series (one per dynamic label), and rasterises the text into the layer's `contents`. Pre-computation maps each video frame to the nearest data-array index using the same `nearestIndexByTime(gpsAbsTimesMs, target: videoCreation + t*1000)` that drives the cursor sweep — so labels and cursor stay in lock-step. Static labels (`max`, `±X°`, `range`) are baked once into the panel CGImage; only the dynamic lines re-render per frame.

Two gotchas worth remembering — both were the source of multiple bad first attempts:

1. **`videoLayer.frame` MUST equal `parentLayer.frame` MUST equal `videoComp.renderSize`.** When the videoLayer is a smaller sub-region of parent, the CA tool letterboxes the renderSize-sized video composition output to fit inside the videoLayer's bounds, leaving a black gap. To position the video within a larger canvas, set `videoLayer.frame == parentLayer.frame == renderSize` and use the layer instruction's transform to place the source frame in the top region of renderSize. Opaque sibling sublayers (panel `CALayer`s, added AFTER `videoLayer`) cover the empty bottom of the video render.
2. **`UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat.scale` defaults to device scale (3× on iPhone).** For offline export rendering, this allocates `3× × 3×` pixels — a 1080×3200 canvas becomes a 31 MP bitmap. Set `format.scale = 1` for any export-only render to keep it at native pixel dimensions.
3. **Custom CALayer animating non-standard property:** subclass `CALayer`, declare `@NSManaged var prop: CGFloat`, override `needsDisplay(forKey:)` to return `true` for that key, override `display()` to rasterise contents based on `presentation().prop`. Then attach a `CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "prop")`. This is how `LiveValueLayer` re-renders text every frame against the video clock without thousands of pre-baked CGImages.

Progress is polled from `session.progress` on a background `Task` every 100 ms — `AVAssetExportSession` exposes progress as a property rather than a callback.

After export, a **"Play composite video"** button presents `AVPlayerViewController` in a `.fullScreenCover` for the just-written file URL. This deliberately avoids deep-linking into the Photos app — iOS has no public scheme to open a specific `PHAsset` by `localIdentifier` (`photos-redirect://` only opens Photos's main view, and anything that takes an asset ID is private API). In-app playback gives the same UI Photos uses internally (transport controls, AirPlay, PiP) and skips the app switch.

### Rides tab — watch GPS on a map (v1.0.23+)

**Row stats (11.7.2026+):** each ride row shows start–end time (local,
derived from the filename's UTC stamp + tick span), duration, outlier-hardened
top speed, and — on rides recorded by an Ultra with the new `WaterTemp [C]`
column — the median water temperature. Parsed once per (path, size) by the
`RideStatsLoader` actor; the mtime + size subtitle shows until the parse lands.
The watch logger (`WatchGpsLogger`) writes the temp column from
`WaterTempManager` (`CMWaterSubmersionManager`, submersion-gated, Ultra-only;
blank when dry or unsupported) via a provider closure set in
`SessionController.start()`.

**One continuous track, coloured by activity (v1.0.24+ — replaced the
blackout hole-splitting).** The old `cleanTrackSegments` broke the polyline
across every ≥2 s fix hole; on a real swim/foil session that produced *seven
disconnected segments* ("too many holes"). `RideMapRenderer.cleanTrack` now
draws **one continuous line**: `validPoints` (the `hdop ≤ 50` gate still drops
the WiFi-fallback fix 70 km away, honestly stamped accuracy 149 000 m — that
outlier is the *only* across-town risk, so once it's gone every gap is safe to
bridge) → `dedupFixes` (collapse the watch's rewritten last-known-location
stall rows) → `despike` (drop a lone fix reached+left by two >45 m hops within
2.5 s while its neighbours sit <45 m apart — 1-sample GPS glitches of
100–380 km/h that draw a zig-zag spur). Only a genuine >200 m teleport breaks
the line (`CleanTrack.breaks`; never happens in practice after the accuracy
gate). Verified against the 11.7.2026 ride: 7 segments → 1 line, no hops >150 m.

**Activity classification (`RideActivity`).** Colour = inferred activity, not
raw speed, when the ride carries the Ultra's `WaterTemp [C]` submersion column.
`RideActivity.modes(for:)` decides per point, in this order:

1. **Speed vetoes land** — median-smoothed (window 5) `speed ≥ boardKmh` (6)
   → **on board** (crimson). Nobody walks or swims at 16 km/h.
2. **Terminal walk back** — dry, moving points after the last real submersion,
   when that tail travels >60 m, are **on land** (amber).
3. **WHERE** — `waterRegion`, a ~70 m grid dilated by ±2 cells (~140 m) around
   every *proven-water* fix: the confirmed-wet fixes **plus every fix crossed at
   board speed between the first and last submersion** (you cannot foil across a
   car park). Outside it → **on land**.
4. **WET** — `stickyWet` (a submersion reading within ±45 s) → **in water /
   swim** (cyan); dry and slow but on the water → **on board** (a drift or a
   wait between runs).

Runs shorter than `minRunSec` (20 s) are absorbed into their longer neighbour
(`smoothKeys`) so the track shows sustained bands, not per-fix flicker.

**Modes are coloured cyan (in water) / crimson (on board) / amber (on land).**
The original blue/green/orange was picked for meaning, not legibility: green sat
on the light map's pale-blue sea at barely any contrast, and blue "in water" was
near-invisible on the water it named. These three read against the sea, the land,
and each other in BOTH map appearances.

**Map tiles follow the system appearance.** The shared PNG must be told which —
`MKMapSnapshotter` rendered off the main actor does NOT inherit the app's trait
collection, so `RideMapView` reads `\.colorScheme` and passes it into
`RideMapRenderer.render(rows:title:dark:)`. Without that a dark-mode user would
get a light-mapped PNG. (`scripts/ride_map_png.swift` mirrors this: system
appearance by default, `MLDARK=1` to force dark.)

**Speed only ever rules land and swim OUT; it never tells them apart** — at
swim/foil speeds GPS noise spikes cross any threshold, so board-vs-swim stays
the submersion sensor's job. That asymmetry is the 13.7.2026 fix: seeding the
water region on the wet fixes ALONE is far too tight. On a 125-min sea session
the sensor fired on only 2.1 % of fixes (159 of 7492, 20 grid cells), so every
stretch more than 140 m from one of them fell outside the region and was called
"on land" — 22 % of the ride, at a median 16.5 km/h, on a rider who never once
went ashore. The fast track now seeds the region too, and a moving fix can no
longer be land at all. Genuine walks (2–3 km/h, off the water) are unaffected —
verified against the 12.7 rides, whose walk up into the town still reads land.

**Submersion is the only reliable wet/dry signal** — proven necessary: on the
temp-less 10.7/11.7 files, speed+altitude mislabels ~80 % as "swim" and flickers
false "land" mid-ride (GPS altitude is ±several m of noise at sea level), so
**rides with no submersion column degrade to a speed gradient** (blue slow → red
fast) with a "no submersion data" note rather than guessing land vs water.
`RideActivity.hasSubmersion` (≥1 finite `waterTempC`) picks the path. The
`WaterTemp [C]` column is already in the watch source (`WatchGpsLogger.swift`) —
a watch that recorded before that build was installed produces temp-less rides,
so existing rides show the speed fallback until a fresh ride is recorded with
the updated watch app.

`RidesScreen` lists the Apple-Watch ride CSVs that `WatchRideReceiver` mirrors into `Documents/WatchRides/`. Each row is a `Button` presenting **`RideMapView`** (`UI/RideMap.swift`) as a `.fullScreenCover`; the raw CSV `ShareLink` stays on the row (with `.borderless` so the tap doesn't also fire the nav).

- **Interactive view** — `RideMapView` parses the CSV with `CsvParsers.parseGpsFile` (which also accepts the watch logger's bracketed `Lat [deg]` / `Lon [deg]` / `SpeedKMh` headers — see the CSV-schema note), builds the coloured runs via `RideMapRenderer.mapRuns(clean:)` and draws **one `MapPolyline` per colour run** (adjacent runs share their boundary point so the line stays continuous across a colour change), with green **Start** / red **End** annotations and a translucent **legend card** (`.overlay(.bottomLeading)`) — mode swatches when submersion data exists, a speed-gradient bar otherwise. The speed fallback approximates the gradient with 6 smoothed speed bands. Camera frames the track via `.rect(RideMapRenderer.boundingRect(trackPoints))`.
- **Shareable PNG** — the toolbar Share button calls `RideMapRenderer.render(rows:title:)`, which uses **`MKMapSnapshotter`** (NOT `ImageRenderer` — SwiftUI's `Map` snapshots blank because tiles render out-of-process) to grab real Apple Maps tiles, then draws over the snapshot with CoreGraphics: a white casing (one continuous sub-path per non-broken run), then the track **edge-by-edge** in the activity-mode colour (or the speed gradient `speedColor`, `robustMaxSpeed` = 95th-pct), start/end dots, and a branded footer. The footer is a **horizontal legend strip along the top** (activity swatches left→right, or a speed-gradient scale — deliberately its own band so the long source-URL line can never collide with it), a divider, then the **app logo** (`RideLogo` imageset — a copy of the app icon, since `UIImage(named:)` can't reliably load an `AppIcon` set), ride **stats** (top speed via `RideMapRenderer.robustTopSpeed` — hard 60 km/h clip + blackout adjacency + ±1 s chord consistency; distance via `trackDistanceKm` over the continuous track skipping breaks + `trackMaxHopM` glitch hops; duration), and the **GitHub source link** (`RideMapRenderer.sourceURL`). The PNG lands in `Documents/RideMaps/<name>_map.png` and is handed to a `UIActivityViewController` share sheet. `snapshot.point(for:)` returns points in the snapshot image's own space, so the track aligns to the tiles with no manual flip on iOS.
- **`scripts/ride_map_png.swift`** is the standalone macOS twin of `RideMapRenderer` (AppKit/`NSImage` instead of UIKit): `swift scripts/ride_map_png.swift <in.csv> <out.png> [logo.png]`, `MLDEBUG=1` to print the classified runs. It ports the same continuous-track cleaning + `RideActivity` classifier + legend, and is how the v1.0.24 rendering was verified on the Mac (incl. a synthesised `WaterTemp` column to exercise the 3-mode path). **It does NOT flip `point(for:)`** — that was a bug (fixed 13.7.2026): on AppKit `snapshot.point(for:)` already comes back in the same y-up space the snapshot image is drawn in, so the old `y = footerH + (mapH - p.y)` mirrored the whole track against the tiles. It silently invalidates any visual check made with this script — a due-north synthetic track drew its start at the top, and the 12.7 walk into town appeared out at sea. iOS is y-down and likewise needs no flip.

### GPS Debug tab — u-blox UBX survey over BLE

Live u-blox diagnostics for antenna selection/mounting, bridged over the box's
BLE link (no cable). Port of the desktop `gps-debug` survey. Files:
`BLE/GpsDebugModel.swift` (UBX parser + NAV/MON decoders + poll scheduler + CSV
writer), `UI/GpsDebugScreen.swift` (the tab). Wiring notes:

- **Protocol.** Two firmware opcodes on the same FileCmd char: `0x0D`
  GPS_BRIDGE `<u8 on>` and `0x0E` GPS_TX `<raw UBX>`. While the bridge is on the
  box relays raw UBX reply frames back as **FileData notifies**. `BleClient`
  holds a `bridgeActive` flag; when set, `onNotification` diverts FileData bytes
  to a new `.ubxFrame(Data)` event **before** the `op` state machine — the survey
  and a FileSync READ can't share the FileData channel, so the survey refuses to
  start unless the worker is idle, and `FileSyncViewModel` gates keep-synced /
  the manual queue on `gpsSurveyActive`.
- **Survey loop.** `GpsDebugModel` runs a 1 Hz `Timer` on `RunLoop.main`: each
  tick flushes the epoch collected over the last second (writes CSV rows +
  a live-summary line) then re-sends the five poll frames (NAV-PVT/DOP/SAT/SIG,
  MON-RF). `feed(_:)` is called from `onEvent` (@MainActor) so parsing, epoch
  accumulation, and file IO all run single-threaded on main — no locks.
- **Output.** `<label>_gnss_epoch.csv` + `<label>_gnss_signals.csv` in
  `Documents/`, byte-identical schema to the desktop tool.
- **Non-destructive.** Only zero-length polls are sent; the box enables UBX
  output in the receiver's RAM layer only (reverts on power-cycle). Needs box
  firmware ≥ v0.0.18 (bridge opcode + MAX-M10S UBX-output fix); older firmware
  ignores 0x0D and the survey shows "no NAV-PVT reply".

## Race mode — live position uplink (`Location/RaceUplink.swift`)

Race-day streaming to the desktop app's **Race** tab (`race.rs`, which
owns the wire doc): a card at the bottom of the GPS tab (rider name +
desktop `ip:port` + source picker, persisted in `UserDefaults
race.*`) toggles an `NWConnection` UDP uplink firing one JSON datagram
per fix, throttled to 5 Hz — `{"v":1,"rider":..,"src":"phone|watch",
"lat":..,"lon":..,"kmh":..,"deg":..,"ts":<epoch ms>,"batt":0-100}`,
default port 47777 (shared with Android `RaceUplink.kt`).

- **iPhone GPS source**: hooked in `GpsCore.didUpdateLocations`;
  enabling race mode auto-`start()`s `GpsCore` so there's no separate
  Start tap to forget.
- **Apple Watch source**: the phone pushes `raceRelay` + the full
  target config (`raceRider`/`raceHost`/`racePort`) via application
  context; `WatchSync` (watch) then streams each 1 Hz
  `WatchGpsLogger.writeRow` fix while a recording runs — via
  `sendMessage(["raceFix": …])` → `WatchRideReceiver` → phone
  `RaceUplink` when the phone is reachable, or **directly over the
  watch's own WiFi** (`WatchRaceUplink.swift`, NWConnection UDP, same
  wire format, watch battery %) when it isn't — watch-only riders
  work on venue WiFi after one setup moment near the phone. Config
  persists in watch UserDefaults. A cellular watch can't reach a
  private LAN address; phone-free-over-LTE needs the future relay.
  Off by default so ordinary rides don't spend battery.
- `sendFix` is gated on the *configured* source so a running iPhone
  GPS can't inject fixes into a watch-sourced race.
- New files must be registered in `project.pbxproj` by hand (explicit
  file references, no synchronized folders) — `RaceUplink.swift` is
  IDs `A1…0404`/`A1…0414`.

## iOS BLE specifics that differ from Android

- iOS doesn't expose stable MAC addresses; `CBPeripheral.identifier` is a `UUID` scoped to this app installation. The view-model uses that UUID instead of an address. To connect, the client must hold the `CBPeripheral` reference from the scan — we keep a `[UUID: CBPeripheral]` map populated during `centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:)`.
- iOS hides the CCCD write — `setNotifyValue(true, for:)` does it for you. We use the `peripheral(_:didUpdateNotificationStateFor:error:)` callback as the "we're subscribed, emit `.connected`" signal (same role as the Android port's `onDescriptorWrite`).
- `writeValue(_:for:type: .withoutResponse)` is fire-and-forget on iOS — no completion callback (in contrast to write-with-response). The 500 ms post-START_LOG sleep is preserved because the write-without-response on the underlying L2CAP socket can return before the bytes are actually transmitted, same race as Android/Rust.
- iOS BLE scanning with `withServices: nil` requires the app to be in the foreground. That's fine for this app. We filter by `CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey == "PumpTsueri"` in the discover callback, mirroring the Android/desktop clients.

## Box-sourced board-orientation calibration (v1.0.17+) — `Calibration.swift`

The four calibration fields (`nosePlusY`, `magOffsetMg`, `angleZeroRef`
+ `angleZeroAtEpoch`, `headingBiasDeg`) live on the BOX in `CAL.CFG`
(firmware v0.0.37+) — the app still mirrors them into `UserDefaults`
via `AgentConfig`, but the BOX is now the source of truth. That means
a "Zero here" or nose toggle done on the iPhone is visible to the
Desktop and Android on their next connect (and vice versa).

- **Wire format** (32-byte blob, per-field `validMask`, tenths-of-degree
  fixed point, LE `UInt64` epoch ms): `MovementLogger/BLE/Calibration.swift`
  — `encode(_:)` / `decode(_:)`. 1:1 port of desktop
  `stbox-viz-gui/src/calibration.rs`; byte-compatible.
- **On connect**: `FileSyncViewModel.queryCalibration(attempt:)` chains
  a `CAL_GET (0x13)` after the GPS-power reply lands, same
  self-guarded slot pattern as `GET_MODE` / `GET_VERSION`. Reply →
  `BleEvent.calibration(Data?)` → `onCalibrationBlob` merges each
  non-nil field into the VM's `@Published` props + `AgentConfig`;
  fields the box hasn't set yet leave the local value alone. Legacy
  firmware (< v0.0.37) times out silently (`.calibration(nil)`) — the
  app keeps its UserDefaults as before.
- **On any user tap**: `pushCalToBox(_:)` fires `CAL_SET (0x14)` with
  ONLY the touched field's bit set — the box's per-field merge leaves
  the other fields alone. Call sites: `zeroBoardAngles`,
  `clearBoardAngleZero`, `setDirectionSouth`, `setDirectionFromPhone`,
  `resetMagCalibration`, and the new `confirmNoseUp(_:)` (which pushes
  nose + nudged bias atomically in one blob — the strict single-op
  BLE slot rejects a second write while the first is in flight, so
  the two-field combined send matters).
- **Deliberately not synced**: continuous mag-offset auto-cal. Would
  churn `CAL.CFG` on every convergence step. Only the explicit
  `resetMagCalibration` tap pushes zeros. Desktop + Android make the
  same tradeoff.

## BLE protocol gotchas (carried over from the Rust/Kotlin clients)

- Subscribe to FileData notifications **once per connection**, not per op. Subscribing per op risks losing the first packet if the box notifies before we're ready.
- READ's first packet may be a 1-byte status error OR file content. Disambiguate: first packet, exactly 1 byte, AND byte ∈ {0xB0, 0xE1, 0xE2, 0xE3} → treat as error. Otherwise treat as content. CSV/log files start with ASCII text (well below 0x80) so the test is unambiguous in practice.
- LIST may not deliver its terminator `\n` on flaky links. Inactivity fallback: ≥1 row seen and 500 ms with no new bytes → treat as `listDone`. Without this fallback the next op trips the "another op is in flight" guard for 20 s.
- The ~500 ms settle after START_LOG is kept (write-without-response returns when bytes are queued, not transmitted), but `startSession()` no longer queues a Disconnect — current firmware (v0.0.7+) opens a fixed-duration session and stays connected instead of rebooting. The same 500 ms guard still matters before any *other* follow-up command.

## CSV-schema gotchas

- **Two firmware schemas, accepted side-by-side.** Pre-22.4.2026 firmware writes `Time [10ms]`, `AccX [mg]`, `GyroX [mdps]`, `MagX [mgauss]`, `P [mB]`, `T ['C]`, `UTC`, `Lat`, `Lon`, `Alt [m]`, `Speed [km/h]`, `Course [deg]`, `Fix`, `NumSat`, `HDOP`, `Voltage [mV]`, `SOC [0.1%]`, `Current [100uA]`. Post-22.4.2026 firmware switched to compact names: `ms`, `ax_mg`, `gx_mdps`, `mx_mg`, `p_hPa`, `t_C`, `utc`, `lat`, `lon`, `alt_m`, `speed_kmh`, `course_deg`, `fix_q`, `nsat`, `hdop`, `v_mV`, `soc_x10`, `i_x100uA`. `CsvParsers` accepts BOTH via `HeaderMap.idxAny(...)` taking variadic candidates. The compact `ms` column is in raw milliseconds, so the parser divides by 10 (`tickDiv = 10.0`) to keep `ticks` in the 10ms-unit the interpolator + fusion code expect. Units are otherwise numerically identical (mg ≡ mgauss, mbar ≡ hPa).
- **Tolerate corrupted rows.** Real SD-card recordings sometimes contain empty fields or jammed values like `-30-123` when the firmware is interrupted mid-write. The earlier parser bailed on the first bad row (throwing "not a float"); this would discard an entire otherwise-good session of ~6000 rows because ~30 were corrupt. Per-row parse errors now `continue` silently instead of throwing. The file loads with the bad rows dropped.
- **Apple-Watch GPS header (v1.0.23).** The watch's own `WatchGpsLogger` writes bracketed column names — `Lat [deg]`, `Lon [deg]`, `SpeedKMh` — which the box-firmware exact-match `idxAny("Lat","lat")` / `idxAny(…,"speed_kmh")` did NOT recognise, so `parseGpsFile` would throw on a watch ride CSV. `parseGpsText` now also accepts `"Lat [deg]"` / `"Lon [deg]"` / `"SpeedKMh"`, so the Rides map (and Replay) read watch rides unchanged. The comment in `WatchGpsLogger.swift` claiming the parsers "read it unchanged" is only true since this fix.

## Numerics gotchas

- `GpsMath.rollingMedianSimple` allocates a buffer of `w + 1` (not `w`) because a centred window at the array's middle covers `2·half + 1` elements — odd windows fit `w`, even windows need one more slot. Tests cover both parities in the Android repo.
- `Fusion.noseAngleSeriesDeg` uses a 60 s rolling median for drift baseline. At 100 Hz that's a 6000-sample window — the simple O(n·w·log w) impl is unusable on long sessions. `GpsMath.rollingMedian` auto-dispatches to the sorted-array fast path for windows ≥ 32 and inputs ≥ 64.
- Madgwick output is sensitive to mount orientation. The desktop GUI has a `--mount mast|deck` flag in `animate_cmd.rs`; the Replay tab currently assumes the same mount as `animate_cmd.rs`'s default (Y axis along the board nose). If a future user reports inverted pitch, surface this as a UI toggle.
- **ThreadX HSI clock drift**: the SensorTile.box's ThreadX runs on the internal RC oscillator (±1 % accuracy) so its 10 ms tick drifts ~7 s over a 21-min session. Sensor-side absolute UTC MUST be built by piecewise-linear interpolation across GPS row `hhmmss.ss` strings (see `ReplayViewModel.interpolateSensorAbsTimes`), not by single-anchor extrapolation. Same trick the Rust `animate_cmd.rs::resolve_at_window` uses.

- **Phone-clock `# SYNC` anchors (primary alignment, firmware v0.0.10+)**: the firmware's `SET_TIME` handler appends `# SYNC epoch_ms=<u64> tick_ms=<u32>` comment lines into the open `Sens*/Gps*.csv` on every connect (`tick_ms` = the box's raw `HAL_GetTick()` ms — the SAME clock as the `ms` column). `CsvParsers.parseSyncAnchors` pulls these into `[SyncAnchor]` (tick in 10 ms units via the same `÷tickDiv` as rows; sorted + deduped). When a sensor/GPS CSV carries anchors, `ReplayViewModel.applyVideoAndSlice` builds abs-times via `absTimesFromSyncAnchors` (piecewise-linear across anchors, constant 10 ms/tick outside) **in preference to** the GPS `hhmmss.ss` path. Why this is better: the anchors are the phone's wall clock — the SAME clock domain as the replay video's `creation_time` — so they remove the cross-clock skew between the box GPS clock and the iPhone video clock, are drift-free across a session (one anchor per connect), need NO GPS fix, and make the alignment date / midnight-rollover handling irrelevant (the anchor carries absolute epoch directly). The GPS-`hhmmss.ss` interpolation remains the fallback for legacy / never-connected files; `vm.alignmentSource` surfaces which path is active ("Phone-clock sync — exact" vs "GPS-derived time" vs "Approximate …"). The data-row parsers skip the `#` line naturally (it fails the float parse and `continue`s), so anchor parsing is a cheap separate pass that never disturbs row parsing.

- **Auto-pick by recorded time**: `autoPickMatchingCsvs` now has three tiers — (1) **wall-clock coverage**: `wallClockCoverage` maps a candidate file's first/last row tick → epoch via its `# SYNC` anchors; the file whose recording span contains the video's `creation_time` IS the session, no filename guessing; (2) **numeric-suffix companion**: `SENS002 ↔ GPS002` (the desktop's canonical pairing) pulls the partner of a coverage-matched file across; (3) the legacy **filename-token overlap + ±7-day mod-date** heuristic as fallback. The summary line shows "(by recorded time)" when tier 1 hit.
